	* [Main App Integration Link](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_5)
	* This task was done by Huye and demoed to the T.A as well showcasing the parsing of JSON directly to the planner without the need for import. 


* [Continuing Code Commenting and Code Refactoring| Ehtisham]( https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/Eht_new_working_branch)

	 * This was fixed by Ehtisham before the App deployment. 
 * [Code Refactoring](https://github.com/Asrarfarooq/Mapalyze/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_5%2B6)
	 * Huy worked on this one and added code comments for better detailing out the code.
	 * [He also updated appinterface to import json file and to post json file to react planner backend and added comments to this one as well.](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_5%2B6)
 * [Research on API Endpoints in Azure](https://asrarfarooq.github.io/MapalyzeDocs/research/research-API-endpoint.docx)
	 * Mai worked on API end point research which will help us in subsequent sprints to determine how we go about connecting and deploying our own editor API 
* Continue Researching and Refining the Base Parser
	* As discussed in the meeting by Nikhil that he is continuously working on refining the base parser is going forward by adding parsing support for more elements  
 * [Working on Finishing JSON Class for Vertices](https://asrarfarooq.github.io/MapalyzeDocs/research/line.py)
	 * This was done by Nikhil and he's work can be found in the link. 

## Sprint 7 
* [Continuing UI/UX Improvements](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_7%2B8)

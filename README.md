	 * This was fixed by Ehtisham before the App deployment. 
 * [Code Refactoring](https://github.com/Asrarfarooq/Mapalyze/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_5%2B6)
	 * Huy worked on this one and added code comments for better detailing out the code.
	 * [He also updated appinterface to import json file and to post json file to react planner backend and added comments to this one as well.](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_5%2B6)
 * [Research on API Endpoints in Azure](https://asrarfarooq.github.io/MapalyzeDocs/research/research-API-endpoint.docx)
	 * Mai worked on API end point research which will help us in subsequent sprints to determine how we go about connecting and deploying our own editor API 
* Continue Researching and Refining the Base Parser
	* As discussed in the meeting by Nikhil that he is continuously working on refining the base parser is going forward by adding parsing support for more elements  
 * [Working on Finishing JSON Class for Vertices](https://asrarfarooq.github.io/MapalyzeDocs/research/line.py)

* Implementation of Login/Signup after Database Deployment
	* We identified a critical issue in the app where users can bypass the login process. Even without successful authentication, users can access the main app through the navigation header/bar.
	* [We decided to fix the problem in sprint 7 and will continue doing it in sprint 8](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_7%2B8)
* Implementing the First Phase of Parser-Editor API
* Starting Research on Navigation inside 3D Models for the Second Half of the Project

## Sprint 8
- [Continue UI/UX Improvements](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/tree/huy_working_branch_sprint_7%2B8)
	- The Login & SignUp was refined and other improvements to visitations were done as well. 
- Continue Code Refactoring
- Continued Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Do More Research on Integration of Database into Azure
	- The research was done was will be demoed next week, since it is not on GitHub 
- [Fix the login/signup Logic Problems on Current App for Doing Database Deployment](https://github.com/Ehtishammushtaq/EECS581-Capstone/blob/huy_working_branch_sprint_7%2B8/Mapalyze/Mapalyze/ClientApp/src/ProtectedRoute.js)
	- This was fixed by Huy by adding protected routes. 
- Continue Implementing the First Phase of Parser-Editor API
	- [A video demo of the First phase of parser.]([https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/personal/n210s707_home_ku_edu/Documents/Attachments/1000014328.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=NtPwsO&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D](https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/n210s707_home_ku_edu/Ef1kPTCvLzJCgGmiqpEb3RkB2htLWiVRY7cmwQZ7-9TwaQ?e=QMBIs5))
- [Continue Research on Navigation inside 3D Models for the Second Half of the Project](https://asrarfarooq.github.io/MapalyzeDocs/research/ArtifactScrappedDoc.pdf)
	- This was scraped due to a change of plans after careful research, this step required sophisticated pathfinding algorithms such as A*, the determination of specific floors is very hard to implement and we decided to put off this feature for now.
